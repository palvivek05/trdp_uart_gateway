notes on targeting the PikeOS Posix VOS

Disclaimer: This port is not endorsed, nor supported by Sysgo. It may be of low quality or using a suboptimal approach.

Sysgo PikeOS has a slightly different build-structure. It could be realized also in this context, but I don't see any good use now. Update: I must not publish, but I may can provide a build-project setup on request.

The Sysgo PikeOS Posix personality package comes with a version of lwIP. It contains few additions / patches to interface nicely with the PikeOS Posix environment (also see a comment in src/vos/pikeos-posix/vos_private.h about this Posix approach).
I also provide a patch to return the destination address through recvfrom() without changing the socket API, as the API has a thin redirection layer as part of Sysgo's adaptations. In fact, I made recvfrom() return an additional address structure, so 2 instead of 1, if socklen hints that there is enough space.

Steps:
 (1) compile lwIP as a custom library, (2) compile trdp as a library, (3) compile your Posix application, linking those two libraries.
